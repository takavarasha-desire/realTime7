# Emotion Recognition
The project entails the creation of an artificial intelligence application, designed to empower the marketing
department in gauging the emotional responses of individuals engrossed in their advertisements. This innovative
system is engineered to deduce the emotional states from facial expressions captured during the viewer's 
interaction with the ad. The application's core functionality is to classify the observed emotional states 
into seven distinct categories: anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, and surprise, employing the 
sophisticated capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) by capturing the video frames of the human
faces and classifying them uing the trained model.
